Make a simple one-page web application that provides the user with a text input field where they can paste in even very large blocks of text, and also, allows them to upload pdf, txt, and other text documents.

The pasted text or uploaded text document is then presented for speed-reading. For the speed reading, one word at a time is flashed on the screen. The word is centered, with the letter which is at the center of the screen being highlighted.

Give the user toggle-switch options and a speed adjuster option; they should be able to set how many words per minute will flash on the screen, and toggle on or off the "highlight letter at center of word/screen". The center letter when hilighted should be red (not too bright a red, but not very dark either).

Give the user a pause/play control, and a "skip backward" and "skip forward" control. These should be controllable via the keyboard, i.e. left arrow skips backward (one word per click) and right arrow skips forward (one word per click); space bar presses play or pause.

The user should also have a control that adjusts the font size.

When the user is not moving the mouse, and the words are being played back, the toggle-switch options and other settings and adjusters, including the pause/play controls and skip forward and back controls, should all fade and disappear entirely, so that the screen has only the flashing words on-screen. When they move the mouse, the controls should fade back into visibility; likewise, if they hit any buttons on the keyboard the controls should become visible again. After words are playing, a few seconds after playback starts, the controls should fade to invisible.
